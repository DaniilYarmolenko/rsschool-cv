## About me
  I am 22 years old. I am a master‚Äôs student in Geology at the Department of hydrogeology of MSU. I am currently writing degree work - "Prediction of the transport of groundwater pollution using the random walk method..". I've always been interested in programming. I started by studying C. Now I have basic skills in Swift, Python and Dart. For my degree work, I decided to create a web and mobile application: [GitHub](https://github.com/DaniilYarmolenko/randomWalk.git).
  I believe that flutter is the future, however, now it is little developed. Since version 2.0 flutter has become null safety and many packages have not been updated.
  As a result: I want to learn more about ios, android, desktop, web development, because in my department all the software runs on the bios and this is sad. 
I have a lot of ideas for geological (petroleum and hydrogeology) software.

## My skills (programming)
no experience in production (JunJun üòÇ)
* C
* Swift
  * including basic SwiftUI
* Dart (Flutter)
* Python
* Kotlin
* SQL (PostgreSQL)

## Experience
  I have no experience in production development.
  However, I have worked in Europe's largest diamond quarry, an oil field in Siberia, and a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.
  Now I work at Geolink consulting in Moscow. The work is boring and uninteresting. I really like to create something new)

## Education
  I think that it is not necessary to write about geological education :relieved:
  Sometimes I'm ashamed to admit it - I'm a pirate ‚ò†Ô∏è I took courses from otus, geekbrains, and yandex. But the main disadvantage in my method is the lack of mentors and support. Sometimes it is difficult to force yourself to go to the goal and jump to another topic (I studied it even Vapor üò≥).

## English
My weakest point... My level is probably under-intermediate. Online translator as a drug - I can't retrain. I study English every day.
